# Mutuca

Mutuca is an education game made by Leonardo F Xavier during his monograph project in 2015 ~ 2016.

The entire project was written only with Python and Pygame.

Mutuca is a COMPLETE example of the use of PYGAME.

I know that all this code is badly commented and some parts are poorly implemented, but I did it all by myself and would like to share it with anyone who wants to learn about the Pygame library.

You can see more about Mutuca on this video of the first version tested.
